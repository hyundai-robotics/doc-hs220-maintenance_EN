-	As bend-resistant wirings are used, so never use wirings other than the specified ones.<p>
-	Replace wirings on a unit-by-unit basis for individual units.<p> 
-	Do not use cables, protection springs, hoses, etc., if they have external damage, other types of damage, etc. because they can cause troubles.<p> 
-	When purchasing the internal wirings for the manipulator, contact our service department about the wiring type.<p>
-	Specify the length of the wirings from the manipulator to the controller.
