    <td colspan="4">If the grease is not properly injected, the internal pressure in the injection part may suddenly increase, causing oil seal damage, oil leakage, and abnormal operation. An abnormal sound may occur when replacing the current grease with new grease of a different specification, so make sure that different types of grease should not be mixed. Therefore, you must observe the following items when injection grease.</td>

<ol style="list-style-type:decimal" start="1">
		<li>
Must wear protective glasses before injecting or inspecting the grease.
  </li><br>
    <li>
Must remove the outlet plug before injecting the grease.
  </li><br>
    <li>
When the plug is loosened, the grease and plug may be abruptly discharged. Block the outlet with a thick cloth to prevent the discharged object from damaging parts of your body, such as the face, and keep a safe distance (Do not look into the grease outlet.)
  </li><br>
    <li>
If possible, do not use a compressed air pump powered by factory-supplied air, and limit the grease injection pressure to 1.5 bar (1.5 kgf/cm2, 0.15 MPA) or less. 
  </li><br>
    <li>
Use only the specified grease. Otherwise, the reducer may be damaged or other problems may be caused.
  </li><br>
    <li>
After injecting the grease, check whether there is any leakage from the grease outlet and whether there is any pressure at the inlet. Remove the residual pressure according to the method suggested for each axis, and then connect the plug.
  </li><br>
    <li>
To prevent accidents, wipe off any spilled grease on the robot body or floor.
  </li><br>
    <li>
If the robot is used at an ambient temperature of 35℃ or higher, the grease replenishment and replacement cycles should be shortened by half.
  </li><br>
    <li>
When replacing grease, replace the specified amount and inject new grease as much as the amount of the discharged grease.
  </li><br>
    <li>
If an abnormal sound is generated from the reducer part during operation after replenishment or replacement of grease, at low temperature, at low speed, or after long-term non-operation,
you need to operate the robot while checking the state of the abnormal sound for 1 to 2 days. Abnormal sound caused by grease will disappear
  </li><br>
    <li>
If grease with a different specification is injected into a reducer part greased already, an abnormal sound may occur from the reducer part. Therefore, do not mix different types of grease.
  </li><br>
    <li>
An abnormal sound may occur even if the old grease is replaced with the new grease of the same designated specification as the old grease.
  </li><br>
    <li>
Replacing the grease is not a work for completely removing the old grease. A significant amount of old grease will remain.
</li><br>	
</ol>

■ Grease replacement cycle

-	S-axis reducer and arm frame gear box	: Every 24,000 hours
-	Other reducers : Every 12,000 hours
-	Gas spring bearing : Every six months (every three months in adverse situations)



 <br>


■ Measures for and Causes of Abnormal Grease Sound


If an abnormal sound is generated in the reducer part despite using the specified grease, check the condition for 1 to 2 days while performing operation. The abnormal sound usually disappears.

-	It can be checked that the abnormal sound will disappear even when the concerned axis is operated at high speed for about 5 to 10 min or more.
-	When the old grease is discharged as much as possible (about 90% or more) and replaced with new grease, abnormal grease sound can be minimized (When the grease is discharged while the axis is rotating at low speed, the grease discharge time can be shortened.)

Abnormal sound usually occur in the following cases.
-	During operation after replacement of grease/reducer
-	During operation after a long-term non-operation
-	During operation at low speed
-	During operation at low temperature
-	When using unspecified grease
-	Mixing of grease of different specifications
