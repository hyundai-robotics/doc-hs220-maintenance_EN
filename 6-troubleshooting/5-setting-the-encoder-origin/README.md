# 6.5. Setting the Encoder Origin 

If the encoder data shows abnormal values because of some troubles or because of replacement of the motor, the origin of the robot should be set again.

The scale is used as a method for determining the posture and position of each axis of the robot. When the user has replaced the motor, the user should set the encoder by using the origin setting scale for each axis.

Part of this work is to be performed with the Operation Ready function in the [ON] state. Therefore, two people should work in one group. One person should be in a position to press the emergency stop button at any time, and the other person should perform the work quickly while paying special attention to the motion of the robot.
