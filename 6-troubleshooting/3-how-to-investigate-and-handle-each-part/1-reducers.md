# 6.3.1. Reducers

If the reducer is damaged, phenomena such as vibration and abnormal sound will appear. In this situation, abnormalities such as overload and deviation that will interfere with normal operation can be caused, and abnormal heating may occur. Also, there are cases where the robot does not move at all or a position deviation occurs.

When required to replace the reducer, you must fix the arm with a fall-prevention bolt or pin before the work so that the arm does not fall.

* Investigation method

    ① Investigate whether there is any vibration, abnormal sound, abnormal heating, an error because of motor overload, etc. during the operation.

    ② Investigate whether there is any abnormal sound, tool overload, delay in replacement of grease, etc.

    ③ Investigate whether the robot has come into contact with or collided with a peripheral system before the occurrence of the abnormality.
(there are some cases where the reducer is damaged because of a contact-induced impact.)

* Handling method

    ① When it is judged to be the abnormal grease sound,

    - operate the relevant axis at high speed until the grease sound disappears.

    - If the abnormal sound does not disappear even after operating the axis at high speed for a long time, you should discharge the existing grease as much as possible and then inject new grease.

    ② Take measures to prevent tool overload, interference or collision with surroundings.

    ③ It is necessary to replace the reducer in the case of use in an overloaded state, collision, presence of foreign substances inside the reducer, or when grease has not been replaced for a long time. If you have any difficulty in replacing the reducer, please contact our service department.
