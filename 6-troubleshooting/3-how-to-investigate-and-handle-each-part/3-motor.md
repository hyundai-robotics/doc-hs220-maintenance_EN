# 6.3.3. Motor

If there is an abnormality in the motor, abnormal motions such as shaking when stopped, irregular cycle (pulsation), and vibration during operation may occur. In addition, abnormal heating and abnormal sound may occur.

Considering that a similar phenomenon occurs even when the reducer is damaged, you should investigate the reducer and bearing at the same time to determine where the cause is.
