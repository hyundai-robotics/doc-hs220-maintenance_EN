# 6.3.4. Encoder

If an encoder has an abnormality, it may cause position deviation, false operation, runaway, etc., which may lead to shaking when stopping or irregular pulsation. In addition, these troubles have nothing to do with the occurrence of mechanical abnormal sound, heating and vibration.

*	Investigation method

    ①	Investigate whether there is any abnormality in the encoder data.

    ②	Set to the reference position of the adjustment scale and check whether there is any error in the position data.

    ③	While moving each axis of the robot, investigate whether there is an axis showing an irregularity in the data.

    ④	Investigate whether an error does not occur when the servo amplifier board, BD542 is replaced. 
 
*	Handling method

    ①	Check the wiring, and if it is not disconnected, replace the encoder.

    ②	If no error occurs when the servo amplifier board BD542 is replaced, it is required to replace the servo amplifier board.
