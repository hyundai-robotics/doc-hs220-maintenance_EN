# 6.3.5. Gas springs

If the pressure of the gas spring drops excessively, it may cause abnormal heating and overloading in the motor or cause the arm to fall. 
Fill nitrogen gas so that the pressure does not drop more than 5 bar below the reference pressure.

Periodically inject grease into the upper and lower bearings of the gas spring to prevent the bearings from being damaged.

![](../../_assets/작은주의표시.png) Before checking the gas spring, you must ensure that the controller and external power are in the 『OFF』 state. Also, take measures to prevent the controller and external power from being accidently turned 『ON』 by someone else.
You must wear protective glasses when checking the gas pressure.

*	Investigation method

    ①	Check whether the pressure of the gas spring is appropriate.

    ②	Check if powder is generated because of grinding in the bearing part of the gas spring.

    ③	If grease has not been injected into the bearing for a long time, you should operate the robot to check if there is any abnormal vibration.


*	Handling method

    ①	Fill nitrogen gas so that the pressure of the gas spring reaches 140 bar.

    ②	Replace the gas spring with new one when its pressure drops within a short period of time after the filling of nitrogen gas, or when the gas spring has been in operation for a long time at low pressure.

    ③	Fill the grease in the bearing part.

    ④	Replace the bearing if it is abnormal.

    ⑤	If you have any difficulties with the handling method, please contact our service department.

    ⑥	For replenishing the gas, refer to the “Replenishing the Gas in the Gas Spring” section.

    ⑦	For the pressure criteria and replacement, refer to the “Replacing the Gas Spring” section.
