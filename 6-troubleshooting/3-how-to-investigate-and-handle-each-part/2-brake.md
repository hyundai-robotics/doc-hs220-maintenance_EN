# 6.3.2. Brake

When there is an abnormality in the brake, each axis may fall when the Operation Ready function in the [OFF] state. Or, on the contrary, the brake may operate even when the Operation Ready function in the [ON] state. Those situations will cause overload or noise.

![](../../_assets/작은주의표시.png) When required to move the manipulator without turning the motor [ON], you should turn the brake release switch [ON] and then move the manipulator. At this time, because the robot arm will fall because of gravity, you should first take measures to prevent the arm from falling, and then turn the brake release switch [ON.]

-	Investigation method

    While the Operation Ready function is in the [OFF] state, you should check if the operation sound comes from the brake by turning [ON] and [OFF] the brake release switch. If the operation sound of the brake is not heard, the switch is considered to be disconnected (When turning [ON] and [OFF] the brake release switch, you should pay special attention to the falling of the arm. The brake release switch is located on the board on the door side that can be seen when you open the controller door.)

-	Handling method

    Check the wiring, and if it is not disconnected, replace the motor.
