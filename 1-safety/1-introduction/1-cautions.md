<ol style="list-style-type:decimal" start="1">
    <li>
When the robot is transported, installed, or operated, the robot may fall over, get overturned or the arm may fall. Therefore, do not enter the range where the robot may fall over or get overturned or the arm may fall.
</li><br>
    <li>
If the pressure of the gas spring decreases, the robot arm may fall, so never go under in the direction where the arm may fall. To prevent the arm from falling when the pressure of the gas spring is excessively reduced, do not perform operation in a direction other than the direction of the origin of axis 2. Move axis 2 to the origin, and then supplement the pressure of the gas spring or replace the gas spring..
</li><br>
    <li>
Replace the gas spring every 20,000 hours or when the pressure decreases so fast that the proper working pressure (125 bar–140 bar) cannot be maintained.
</li><br>
    <li>
When transporting or carrying out the robot, do not allow a large impact or vibration to be applied to it. In particular, if there is a large impact or vibration when transporting or carrying out a robot with a tool attached, the arm may slip or have a failure.
</li><br>
    <li>
If grease with different specifications are mixed, an abnormal sound may occur, so, do not allow them to be mixed.
</li>
