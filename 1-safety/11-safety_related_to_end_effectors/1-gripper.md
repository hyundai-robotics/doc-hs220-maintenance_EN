		<li>
      When required to use a gripper to hold a workpiece, there should be preparatory measures for unexpected falling of the workpiece.  
    </li>	<br>
		<li>
      When required to mount a device to an end effector or arm, you should use the bolts of specified sizes in specified counts, and use a torque wrench to fully tighten them with the specified torques. Also, the bolts that are not rusted or dirty should be used.
    </li><br>
    <li>
      Manufacture the end effectors considering that it can be used within the allowable load range of the writs of the robot. In addition, the end effectors should be structured in a way that the gripped object will not be released or dropped even when the power or air supply is stopped and also that the corners or protruding parts of it are surely treated to prevent damage to people and objects.
