      It should be made possible to safely change a tool such as a milling cutter. Until the cutter stops rotating, the safety systems should surely perform their functions.

      The tool should be designed so that the workpiece does not fail even when a sudden power outage or control failure occurs. In manual operation mode, it should be made possible to detach the workpiece.
