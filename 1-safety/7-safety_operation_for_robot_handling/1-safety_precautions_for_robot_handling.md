<ol style="list-style-type:decimal" start="1">
<li>
The workers who operate or may operate the robot, and the supervisors must fully recognize the safety and the function of the robot by taking prescribed trainings. The robot must not be operated by anyone other than those who have been so trained and designated. 
</li><br>
    <li>
Must wear a safety hat, protective glasses and safety shoes. 
</li><br>
    <li>
The work must be done by two people. One person performs teaching and the other monitors form the operation panel. One person should be ready to press the emergency stop switch at any time, and the other one should proceed with the works quickly while paying much attention in the operation area. In addition, workers should check the evacuation routes in advance before the work. 
</li><br>
    <li>
First, ensure that there is no worker within the operation area of the robot, and then turn on the power. 
</li><br>
    <li>
In principle, works including teaching should be performed from outside the operation range of the robot. However, when required to stop the equipment and carry out works within the operation range, you need to enter the range while brining in the key switch or safety plug that is used to change to auto operation. It is necessary to ensure that other workers do not mistakenly switch the robot to auto operation. In addition, pay special attention to the operational direction of the robot in preparation for an unexpected situation such as false operations or wrong conditions. 
</li><br>
    <li>
<img src="../../_assets/작은주의표시.png"> In preparation for an unexpected falling of the axis, you must be careful not to place your body in the direction of the falling of the axis or within the range where you may get crushed.
As there is a risk of the axis falling because of the slippage of the motor brake, the failure of the balance, etc., you should check before performing the teaching work. When it comes to the gas spring, you must check that the proper pressure is maintained before carrying out the teaching work.
</li><br>	
<li>
            A supervisor should observe the following items. 
            <ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman" start="1">
                <li>
                Position yourself in a place where you can see the entire robot and devote yourself to the monitoring work.
</li><br>
    <li>
When there is an abnormality, press the emergency stop button immediately. 
</li><br>
    <li>
Make sure that no one other than those involved in the work is within the operation range.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li><br>
<li>
During the manual operation, the speed will be limited to a maximum of 250 mm/sec. 
</li><br>
    <li>
When performing the teaching work, you should put a sign saying [Teaching in Progress.] 
</li><br>
    <li>
When entering inside the safety fence, the workers must pull out the safety plug and bring it with them. 
</li><br>
    <li>
Do not use equipment that may cause noise in or around the place where teaching work is performed. 
</li><br>
    <li>
Handle the teach pendant button while looking at the teaching point with your naked eyes, not by handling it just relying on the feeling of your hands. 

</li><br>
    <li>
<img src="../../_assets/작은주의표시.png">These are the maintenance parts to be prepared when you purchase multiple robots. 
</li><br>
    <li>
During a teaching work, you should fully check under your feet. In particular, secure a safe area that you can set foot on when performing the teaching work at heights (2 m or higher.) 
</li><br> 
        <li>
            <img src="../../_assets/작은주의표시.png">Take following measures when an abnormality occurs 
            <ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman" start="1">
                <li>
                If there is an abnormal operation spotted, press the emergency stop button immediately. 
</li><br>
    <li>
When checking for an abnormality following an emergency stop, you must check the state of the stopping of the related facilities. 
</li><br>
    <li>
If the robot automatically stops because of an abnormality in the power supply, you should first confirm that the robot has stopped completely and then investigate the cause and take measures. 
</li><br>
    <li>
If the emergency stop system does not perform its functions, you should cut off the main power immediately, investigate the causes, and take measures. 
</li><br>
    <li>
No one except for the designated person should investigate the cause. Restarting after an emergency stop should be performed in sequence after the cause of the error is clearly identified and measures are taken. 
                 </li>
            </ol>
        </li><br> 
        <li>
        Create appropriate work regulations regarding not only the methods to drive and operate the robot and robot but also the measures to take against abnormalities in consideration of the location of installation and contents of works. In addition, progress the works in accordance with the work regulations. 
</li><br> 
        <li>Precautions when the robot has stopped
You must avoid blindly approaching the robot assuming it is stationary. There are many cases where a person approached a robot the person thought was stationary, but the robot suddenly moved, resulting in a disaster. When the robot is stopped, it is in the following states.

            Even when access is possible, you should not neglect to pay attention to any possibility of sudden movements. In any case, you must avoid approaching the robot without preparing for an emergency. <br><br>

        After completing the operation of the robot, you should clean the inside of the safety fence and make sure that no tools, oil, foreign substances, etc. are left there. If the operation area is dirty with oil or littered with tools left, an accident such as a falling over may be caused. Always make it a habit to keep things organized and tidy.
