When the test operation is conducted, there may be design errors, teaching errors, or manufacturing defects in the entire system including the teaching program, jigs, and sequences. Therefore, it is necessary to work with more safety awareness in performing the test operation. In some cases, safety accidents may occur because of complex factors. 

<ol style="list-style-type:decimal" start="1">
		<li>
            Before operating the robot, check the functions of the switches and signals that are designed to stop the robot, such as the emergency stop switch and the stop switch. After that, check the operations related to the detection of abnormalities. First, it is most important to check all signals that are designed to stop the robot. When an accident is predicted, the most important thing is to stop the robot..
        </li><br>		
		<li>
            When operating the robot for testing, operate it at low speed using the speed variation function and check the operation while operating the robot repeatedly for more than one cycle. If a problem is found, please correct it immediately. After that, increase the speed sequentially (50% → 75 % → 100 %) and operated the robot repeatedly for more than one cycle at each speed to check the operation. If the robot is operated at high speed from the beginning, it may cause a severe accident. 
        </li><br>	
		<li>
           It is impossible to foresee what problems may arise during the test operation. During the test operation, never go inside the safety fence. Because of low reliability of the system, there is a high possibility that unexpected accidents occur.
