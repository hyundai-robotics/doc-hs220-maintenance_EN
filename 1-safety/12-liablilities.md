# 1.12. Responsibilities

The robot system is manufactured in accordance with the latest technical standards and approved safety specifications. Nevertheless, during use, the robot system may collide with surrounding facilities, which may cause an accident that threatens the life of the operator or injures the arms and legs of the operator. 

The robotic system must be used in a technically perfect condition for its intended use and must be used by operators capable of paying attention to safety with full awareness of the risks involved in operation. The robot system should be used in accordance with the operation instructions and manuals supplied with the robot system. Never use the safety-related functions of the robot system for any other purpose in no case. 

To use the robot system for a purpose other than the designed purpose or for an additional purpose, please review whether the use complies with the intended usage of the design. The manufacturer will not be held liable for any damage or accident caused by such misuse. The users are solely responsible for the misuse. When operating the robot system within the intended usage of the design, you must fully understand the operation manual, which is the standard document for operating the robot. 

Do not use the robot system until the machines or systems included and used in the robot system comply with the EU machinery standards instructed by 98/37/EC (2006/42/EC) and US OSHA.

The standards listed below are related to the safety of the robot system.

Users are responsible for the accidents caused by ignoring these instructions. In addition, the manufacturer is not responsible for the damage caused by the equipment supplied by the user, the equipment not included in the contract with the manufacturer, or the equipment the user arbitrarily configured around the robot system. The user is solely responsible for all risks associated with such equipment.
