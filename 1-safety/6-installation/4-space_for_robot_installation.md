# 1.6.4. Space for Installing the Robot

Install the robot after securing sufficient space for preserving the manipulator, the controller, and other peripheral systems. To install the manipulator and controller, please secure the above mentioned installation area. Install the controller in a place outside the safety fence where the manipulator can be easily seen and works can be carried out safely.

Install the robot so that maintenance work can be done easily when the door of the controller is opened. The specifications of the controller may differ depending on the type of the controller (for more details, please refer to the Maintenance Manual.)
