In order for the robot to fully perform its functions. it should be installed according to a pre-considered, planned foundation and placement. If the installation of the robot is in a poor condition, an error may occur in the relative position between the robot and the workpiece during operation, or vibration may occur, resulting in degradation of the quality of works performed by the robot. In addition, the service life of the robot may get shortened and a dangerous situation can occur. Therefore, when installing the robot, pay attention to the following items.

<ol style="list-style-type:decimal" start="1">
<li>
To protect workers, the system should be designed and installed completely in accordance with the safety requirements specified by the laws and specifications of the country where the robot is installed.
 </li><br>
    <li>
When required to install the robot on the ceiling or wall instead of the floor, you must consult with our engineers.
 </li><br>
    <li>
Workers who use the robot should fully understand the contents described in application and supplementary manuals to skillfully operate and handle the industrial robot. 
 </li><br>
    <li>
Workers who install the robot should be able to apply safety instructions if problems occur during installation. 
 </li><br>
    <li>
System suppliers should ensure that all circuits using safety functions surely perform the functions. 
 </li><br>
    <li>
The main power supplied to the robot should be installed so that it can be cut off from outside the operation area of the robot. 
 </li><br>
    <li>
The system suppliers should clearly ensure that all circuits using the emergency stop function perform the function in a safe manner. 
 </li><br>
    <li>
For a case that requires stopping the robot abruptly, the emergency stop button should be located in a place where workers can easily access it.
</li><br>

<ol style="list-style-type:decimal" start="1">
		<li>
Should take into consideration the size of the manipulator and the operation range to ensure that there is no interference with peripheral devices. 
 </li><br>
    <li>
Avoid installing the robot in a place where direct sunlight reaches, humidity is high, oil or chemicals are present, or a lot of metal powder or explosive gas are in the air.
 </li><br>
    <li>
Install the robot where the ambient temperature is within the range of 0℃–45℃. 
 </li><br>
    <li>
Secure enough space to easily disassemble and inspect the robot.
 </li><br>
    <li>
Install a safety fence and prevent people from entering the operation range of the robot.
 </li><br>
    <li>
Make sure that there is no obstacle in the operation area of the robot.
 </li><br>
    <li>
When required to install the robot in a place exposed to direct sunlight or near a heating element, you should take measures in consideration of the thermodynamic state of the controller.
 </li><br>
    <li>
When required to install the root in a place where there is a lot of dust such as metal powder in the air, you should take separate measures.
 </li><br>
    <li>
Install the robot in a way that the welding current never flows to the robot. In other words, there must be insulation between the spot gun and the wrist of the robot.
 </li><br>
    <li>
Considering that grounding is very important in preventing a false operation because of noise and an electric shock, you should carry out installation as follows.
            <ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman" start="1">
                <li>
            A dedicated grounding terminal should be installed, and its grade must be higher than class 3 grounding (If the input voltage of the robot controller is 400 V or higher, special class 3 grounding or higher should be applied.) 
 </li><br>
    <li>
The grounding wire should be connected to the grounding bus bar inside the control panel. 
 </li><br>
    <li>
When the manipulator is installed, if it is directly grounded to the floor by an anchor, etc., the controller side and the manipulator side constitute two grounding points, conversely causing a closed circuit to be formed with a risk of a false operation because of noise conversely. In this case, connect the grounding wire to the base of the manipulator and do not connect it to the controller side. Also, if vibration occurs when the robot is stopped, it is highly likely that the grounding is incomplete or a closed circuit has formed. Check the grounding again. 
 </li><br>
    <li>
When a transformer-embedded gun is used, there is a risk of falling because the primary power cable is directly connected to the spot gun. In this case, to protect the control panel and prevent an electric shock, you should connect the grounding wire directly to the manipulator base and do not connect it to the controller.
