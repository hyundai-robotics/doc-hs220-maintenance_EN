Even when the robot moves at a slow speed, its weight is quite heavy and its force is very powerful. When entering the safety area of the robot, you must comply with the safety regulations of the concerned country. 

Workers should always be aware that the robot may operate in an unexpected manner. Even when the robot stops moving for a moment, it can move quickly the next moment. The workers should know that the robot can change its path and move according to an external signal without giving a warning. If you want to stop the robot during the teaching or test operation, you must be able to stop it immediately with a teach pendant or operation panel of the controller.

When entering the operation area of the robot through the safety gate, you must bring the teach pendant with yourself. By doing so, you should prevent others from operating the robot. You must hang a sign on the operation panel of the controller to indicate that the robot is currently being operated. 

When entering the operation area of the robot, you must fully understand the following items
