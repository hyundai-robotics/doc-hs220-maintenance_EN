# 1.4.2. Safety Nameplates 

Nameplates, warning marks and safety symbols are attached to the inside and outside of the robot and control panel. The name marks and cable marks for the wire harness between the robot and control panel, and also for the cables inside and outside the control panel are provided.

All types of nameplates are surely attached to the clear locations of the manipulator and control panel to guarantee safety and their functions.

The paint marks for the robot area or the marks for dangerous areas indicated on the floor where the robot is installed should be clearly different in terms of shape, color, and style from other marks in the facility or machine where the robot system is installed.
