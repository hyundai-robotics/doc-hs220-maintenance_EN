Must perform the maintenance and inspection works safely after securing a passage or a place to avoid danger by checking the safety of the surroundings. 
</li><br>
    <li>
Must turn off the power when required to perform daily inspections, repairs, or replacement of parts of the robot. In addition, put a warning sign such as [Do Not Supply Power] on the primary power source so that other workers cannot turn on the power carelessly. 
</li><br>
    <li>
Use only the designated replacement parts. 
</li><br>
    <li>
When required to open the controller door, you must turn off the power and then wait for about three minutes before starting the work. 
</li><br>
    <li>
If sufficient illumination is not secured when maintaining and inspecting the inside of the controller, you should use external lights.
</li><br>
    <li>
Do not touch the heat radiation plate and regenerative resistor of the servo amplifier because they generate excessive heat. 
</li><br>
    <li>
After completing maintenance, you should check if tools or other things are left inside the controller and then securely close the door.
