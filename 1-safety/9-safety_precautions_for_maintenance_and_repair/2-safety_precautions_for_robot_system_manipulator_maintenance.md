Please refer to the safety measures for repairing or inspecting the controller. 
 </li><br>
    <li>
When maintaining and inspecting the robot system or manipulator, you should progress the work according to the instructed procedures. 
 </li><br>
    <li>
Must turn off the main power of the controller. In addition, put a warning sign such as [Do Not Supply Power Input] on the primary power source so that other workers cannot turn the power back on carelessly.
 </li><br>
    <li>
When the manipulator is maintained or inspected, the robot arm may fall or move, causing danger. You must fix the arm before performing the work.
 </li><br>
    <li>
If the pressure of the gas spring decreases, the robot arm may fall, so never go under in the direction where the arm may fall. To prevent the arm from falling when the pressure of the gas spring is excessively reduced, do not perform operation in a direction other than the direction of the origin of axis 2. Move axis 2 to the origin, and then supplement the pressure of the gas spring or replace the gas spring.
