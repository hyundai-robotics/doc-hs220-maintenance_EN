# 2.9. Limitation of the Operation Range

When installing the robot, you need to consider that its operation range can be freely adjusted within the entire operation area. 

It is useful to limit the operation range in the following circumstances.

*	When required to limit the operation area during the operation of the robot.
*	When collision with a peripheral device may occur
*	When the length of the application cable or hose is limited

There are three ways to keep the robot from moving out of its operation area, and they are as follows.

*	Software limit (applicable to all axes)
*	Limit switch (for axes 1 to 3: Optional)
*	Mechanical stopper (for axes 1 to 3)

A mechanical stopper is a physical device. The robot should not be allowed to move beyond mechanical stoppers. The mechanical stoppers for axes 1-3 and 5 are fixed. For axes 4 and 6, only software limits are applied.

Mechanical stoppers will be deformed even when collided upon once, and their strength cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, the impacted mechanical stopper must be replaced.
