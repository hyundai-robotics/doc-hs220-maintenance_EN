# 9.3. Releasing the Gas of the Gas Spring

You should release the gas of the gas spring in the following cases.

-	When the gas spring needs to be separated from the robot, but the H axis cannot be operated, making it impossible to put the H axis at 90°.
-	When required to transport the robot by air (The law restricts that air transport of machinery equipped with high-pressure equipment should be performed after depressurizing it.)
