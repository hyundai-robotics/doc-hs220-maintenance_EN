# 9. Maintaining the Gas Spring

Manage the gas spring so that it has an appropriate pressure through periodic maintenance. Replace the gas spring every 20,000 hours or when the proper working pressure (125 bar–140 bar) cannot be maintained even after gas is injected.

-	Nitrogen gas is filled at high pressure, so the safety regulations of the concerned country should be observed.
-	To prevent the arm from falling, you should maintain the pressure of the gas spring at an appropriate working pressure.
When required to operate the H axis manually, you must first check that the pressure of the gas spring is at an appropriate working pressure.
Never go under in the direction of the arm falling
-	Fill only nitrogen gas.
(Never charge other types of gas but also liquid nitrogen.)
-	Must wear safety glasses when working. 
-	Fill nitrogen gas so that the pressure does not drop more than 5 bar below the reference pressure.
-	Never look directly into the gas inlet and pressure gauge.
-	When the internal parts of the gas spring are damaged, you should secure safety by not placing any part of your body or major equipment in the operation direction of the gas spring, and then completely remove the gas.
(When an internal part is damaged, the compression force causes it to be thrown out at high speed, resulting in a safety accident.)
-	When required to separate the gas spring assembly unit, you should separate it while keeping the H axis of the robot at an angle of 90 degrees (teaching pendant). In this posture, the compression force of the gas spring is minimized, making it possible to separate it (In other postures, the gas spring compression force is high, so the bolts will be thrown out at high speed during the separation work, resulting in a safety accident.)
-	To consider safety and maintain the performance of the product, the works of disassembling and assembling the internal parts of the gas spring can be performed using only designated standard work tools and equipment as well as with appropriate trainings and understanding of the product. Please contact us for any inquiries regarding this.
-	When measuring the gas pressure, you should observe the instruction in the “Checking the Pressure of the Gas Spring” section because incorrect operation of the measuring device or mistakes in operating it may result in a drop in the gas pressure.
-	Before checking the gas spring, you must ensure that the controller and external power are in the 『OFF』 state. Also, take measures to prevent the controller and external power from being accidently turned 『ON』 by someone else.
-	When required to replace the gas spring, you must remove the gas pressure first.
-	When replacing an old gas spring, replace the bearing as well.
-	Regularly inject grease into the bearing part of the gas spring. 
(every 6 months, every 3 months in severe conditions)
-	When purchasing gas injection parts, you should include the specification of the nitrogen gas bombe connection screws.
