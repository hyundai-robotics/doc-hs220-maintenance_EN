# 3.5.7. Connecting a Load

In the case of a load to be attached to the tip of the wrist axis of the robot, you should limit the load attachment method and form to prevent abrasion from being caused by contact with the R1 axis part that performs relative motions. If these limits are not properly applied, the resulting contact may damage the seal and cause oil leakage.
