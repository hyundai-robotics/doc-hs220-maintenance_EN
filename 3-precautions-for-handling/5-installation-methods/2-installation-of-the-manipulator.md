# 3.5.2. Installing the Manipulator

The rigidity of the foundation floor where the robot is to be installed should be able to minimize the dynamic influence of the robot, so the concrete thickness of the floor surface should be 300 mm or more. When installing the robot, you should perform maintenance works for irregularities and cracks on the concrete floor and then fix the mounting plate using the M20 chemical anchor. Also, if the thickness of the concrete floor is less than 300 mm, a separate foundation work is required, so please review this in advance before the construction work.

Position the manipulator on the mounting plate and then fasten it firmly with eight M20 bolts.

*	Bolt	 : M20*70 (strength grade: 12.9) 
*	Flat washer 	  : T = 4 mm or more, inner diameter (ID) = 24, and hardness = HrC 35 or more
*	Tightening torque: 5700 kgfcm
