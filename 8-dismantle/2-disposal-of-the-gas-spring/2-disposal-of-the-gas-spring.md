# 8.2.2. Disposing of the Gas Spring

Because the inside of the gas spring separated from the manipulator is still assembled with a high compression force, you should completely remove the gas according to the procedures of 9.3 Releasing the Gas of the Gas Spring,  and then confirm that the gas is completely removed and then dispose of the gas spring. Also, because a small amount of grease will still remain inside, you should handle it in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations in an environment sensitive to contamination.
